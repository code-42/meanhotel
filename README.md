# meanhotel
Udemy MEAN stack Hotel app

This is my first run of this tutorial in June 2017.
the github repo for this tutorial was https://github.com/code-42/meanhotel
but has been renamed to https://github.com/code-42/meanhotel-BU
and may not be connected properly anymore because I added -BU to the repo name

I am re-running this tutorial for CareerDevs in September 2017
My c9 workspace for the September tutorial is https://ide.c9.io/code42/mean_hotel
